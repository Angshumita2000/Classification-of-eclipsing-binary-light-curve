# Classification-of-eclipsing-binary-light-curve
Classification of eclipsing binary lightcurve is a project done the dataset from Miller 2010 data on eclipsing binary lightcurve. In this particular project we go through a non-linear approach to fit a better model to Classify better with respect to previous work done using interpolation on functional data. This study also dicovers around 21 isolated outliers present in data which gives a deep insight about the database.
